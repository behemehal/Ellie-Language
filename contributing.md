## Development Tips

- If you're getting strange syntax error add `--show-debug-lines` to your `compiler` or `tokenizer` command.
- If internal error occurs, use `--allow-panics` option. You can get rust panics this way.
- For disabling syntax warnings use `--disable-warnings` option.
- For viewing binary module information you can use `viewModule` command. Here is a example output:
```
ModuleName        = ellie
ModuleDescription = A ellie module
ModuleVersion     = 1.0.0
EllieVersion      = 3.0.0
```
- If you're working on issue please create a new issue in [EllieWorks Repo](https://github.com/behemehal/EllieWorks). Submiting issue with id will help us to identify the issue.
